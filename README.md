# My ALS Care
This repository contains content that will be used for the als site
## Tools used to build
We have used **Hugo** to generate the static content of the site. The site is currently deployed in **firebase**
## Why HUGO
Hugo is used as currently the site will hold only static content and people with no experience in development can set up the project and write the content using **markdown**. This can then be published to the site with ease

## Setting up the environment locally
